= Experimental typesetting system (ets)
Patrick Gundlach <gundlach@speedata.de>

This will eventually be the manual of ets. Let's start with some notes.


TIP: This software is unstable in all aspects. The API will change, the code itself
might not work and trying this out might be a waste of time. If you don't care
and want to try out ets, go ahead. Please don't hesitate to get into contact
with the author if you have any suggestions, questions or bug reports.

== What is ets?

ets is just a Lua frontend of https://github.com/speedata/boxesandglue[“boxes
and glue”], a typesetting library written in Go. The library is not meant as a
user friendly software for typesetting tasks (such as TeX). It should be viewed
as a typesetting backend with core functionality such as loading fonts and images,
line breaking, hyphenation and text justification (h&j) and PDF generation. ets
exposes this in a Lua library to play with the data structures and perhaps use this as a base to build your own typesetting frontend.

== Lua frontend

The Lua version is implemented in Go and is based on the semantics of Lua 5.1. It will not be perfectly compatible with the Lua you know from https://www.lua.org[www.lua.org].


== Running the software


Download the software from https://github.com/speedata/ets/releases[GitHub] and navigate to the `ets` folder in the unzipped archive.

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bin/ets somefile.lua
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

starts ets and loads `somefile.lua` in the current directory.

ets will look for a file named `ets.lua` execute its contents before it executes `somefile.lua`. The startup file (`ets.lua`) must have the same name as the binary (`arg[0]`).

== Lua libraries

The following libraries are predefined in the global namespace:

* `document` has all general information about a document / a PDF file.
* `node` represents the smallest units of the typesetting software. Each piece of information (visible and invisible) is stored in the nodes which can also contain references to other nodes. A detailed explanation will follow in a subsequent chapter.


=== Library `document`

.Document table
|===
|Field name | Arguments | Return value |Description
| `info` | string | - | Log with info level.
| `new`  | string | doc | Create a new PDF file.
| `sp`   | string | number | Convert the string to scaled points (1/65536 of a DTP point).
|===

.The doc table

=== Library `node`

.Node table
|===
|Field name | Arguments | Return value |Description
| `new()` |  string |  a node   |  Create a new node of the given type.
| `debug()` | a node  |  -  | Show the node structure in STDOUT.
| `append_lineend()` | a node |  - | Append a penalty (10000), an infinite stretchable glue and a penalty of -10000 at the end of the argument. Used to finish a paragraph.
| `hpack()` |  a node  |  hlist node  | Put the node list in the `list` field of a newly created `hlist` node
| `insertafter()` |  node head, node cur, node newnode |  node   | insert newnode after cur in the list starting with head. Return head.
| `insertbefore()` |  node head, node cur, node newnode |  node   | insert newnode before cur in the list starting with head. Return head.
| `linebreak()` | node list, table parameter  |  vlist   | Break the node list into lines specified by the parameter.
|===


=== Nodes

|===
| Node name | Description
| `disc` |  A hyphenation point.
| `glue` | A stretchable and shrinkable space.
| `glyph` | A single “letter” to be displayed.  This can be anything the font can display.
| `hlist` | A horizontal list.
| `image` | An instance of an image file.
| `lang` | A language node.
| `penalty` | A penalty holds information about a possible line break point.
| `vlist` | A vertical list.
|===

.Common fields of nodes:
|===
| Field name | Description
| `prev` | A link to the previous node of the linked list. Possibly nil.
| `next` | A link to the next node of the linked list. Possibly nil.
|===


==== `disc`

|===
| Field name | Value | Description
| `pre`       | node list | The glyphs that appear at the end of a line during a line break.
|===


==== `glue`
|===
| Field name | Value | Description

| `stretch` | scaled points number | The allowed stretch of the glue.
| `shrink` | scaled points number | The allowed shrink width of the glue.
| `stretch_order` | 0-3 | The infinity order of the stretchability. 0 = finite glue, 1–3: infinite glue.
| `shrink_order` | 0–3 | The infinity order of the shrinkability. 0 = finite glue, 1–3: infinite glue.
|===
